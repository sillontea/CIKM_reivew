Existing models often suffer from limitations in context length (typically 512 tokens), suboptimal architectures, and training data restrictions, hindering performance and efficiency.  These limitations necessitate advancements in encoder models to improve performance on long-context tasks and resource-constrained environments. \n\nThis research introduces ModernBERT, a novel encoder-only model addressing these issues.  **ModernBERT incorporates modern optimizations such as Flash Attention, Rotary Position Embeddings, and GeGLU activations**.  Trained on a massive dataset (2 trillion tokens) with a native 8192 sequence length, **ModernBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks** encompassing diverse tasks and domains, including code retrieval.  Its high efficiency makes it suitable for deployment on common GPUs, providing a significant leap forward in encoder-only models.", "affiliation": "Answer.AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
